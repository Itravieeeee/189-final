            <p>I am on my third year of digital marketing at bellevue college and this quarter, I completed BATECH 189, webpage authoring where I completed all of these projects in this portfolio!</p>
            <p>Three things that I mainly wanted to focus on through this course, making a CSS sheet, being able to make a repository and upload my work, and especially form multiple pages in the same website!</p>
